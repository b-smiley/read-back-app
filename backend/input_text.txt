The State calls Officer Peter Paul.

OFFICER PETER PAUL, Parish Police Department, after having been first duly sworn, did testify as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION -
BY MS. SMITH:
Q. Could you please state your name for the Record?
A. Officer Peter Paul.

Q. Officer, how are you employed?
A. Police officer.

Please let the Record reflect proper in-court identification.

MS. SMITH:
I tender the witness, Judge.

CROSS-EXAMINATION -
BY MS. JANE:
Q. Officer, you were undercover on February, ?
A. Yes.

Q. Would it refresh your recollection if you looked at your police report?

MS. SMITH:
Your Honor, I'm going to object. I don't think it's relevant who did the physical detention of the defendant.

THE COURT:
I will permit it. I will overrule. Would it refresh your recollection, Officer, if you reviewed the police report?

THE WITNESS:
Sure, I will take a look. Yes. In the report it says that I notified him he was under arrest, and read him his rights per Miranda, and arrested him.

MS. JANE:
I have no further questions. Thank you.

MS. SMITH:
The State has no Redirect.

THE COURT:
Thank you, Officer. You may step down.

MS. SMITH:
The State has no further witnesses. Judge, at this time we would offer, file and introduce S- -- for motion purposes only -- S-, which is a copy of the crime lab in this matter showing that the evidence confiscated from the defendant, both the hand-rolled cigar and the nine plastic baggies were each positive for marijuana; and S-, a copy of the defendant's prior conviction.

THE COURT:
Any objection for motion purposes?

MS. JANE:
Not for motion purposes.

MS. SMITH:
With that, Judge, the State submits.

THE COURT:
Anything by the Defense?

MS. JANE:
No.

THE COURT:
Submitted?

MS. JANE:
I would submit.

MS. SMITH:
The State submits.

THE COURT:
The Court finds probable cause as charged. The Court denies the Motion to Suppress Evidence. I will note an objection on behalf of the Defense to the Court's ruling.
